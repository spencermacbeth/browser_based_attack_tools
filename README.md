# browser_based_attack_tools

This repo contains some simple tools I developed to test what sorts of vulnerability probing tools and attacks can be launched using only a browser. The code currently contained here was developed for practicing security concepts. These tools are essentially toy problems, and far more effective tools for all effects achieved here exist. Please use responsibly.

### Running the Examples

Some examples will include a simple PHP server script and some an HTML page. To run the examples, I personally used the built-in PHP server on port 3000. This can be achieved very simply by running the following command:

`php -S localhost:3000`
